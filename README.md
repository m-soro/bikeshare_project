# Introduction

This project took me about 4 days! I was working on it 5-6 hours a day or maybe even more(if you count little spurts of ideas during the day?). The only prep I did for this project was watching and re-watching the demo project more than once just to get the required specs and rubric expectations. 

I completely avoided looking at how others have done this project. Because I wanted this to be my work 100%! and I wanted to **challenge my:**

* **Logical** thinking
* **Research** and **problem-solving** skills
* **Creativity** to come up with other features to add. 

I found the preceeding set of quizzes helpful, because oftentimes its difficult in even where to begin!

## Project Overview

>Overview:
In this project, you will make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. You will write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. You will also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

## Project Expectations:

* **It has to be interactive** - asks for user's input
* **Does not crash** - handles errors
* **Avoids code duplications** - uses functions. *This is where I spent most of my time.* 
* **Use of correct data types**

I looked at the template provided to see the framework and questions provided.

I used all of the questions, but altered the control flow because I had different ideas for the project. 

## Details about my project

**Input Validation Functions** 

* Because this is interactive, I think it makes more sense to have functions that just validates answers. Like `y or n ?`, `input integer?` , `select city?`,  `select month?`, `select day?` and most of the time it really boils down to `y or n ?` question! Thanks to boolean logic!. I found it a lot easier to use these functions in conjuction with the `input` function. Oftentimes it easy to just execute this piece of program and see what and where errors occur.

**Functions in general**

* `lambdas` are like little magic tricks ! Multiple times I thought I was done re-factoring. Since my project has different features than the one shown in the demo. I needed to write a custom function for it. I could script it as pieces of code but I found it really hard to encapsulate them in a function. I did't know that `lambda` has to have a return value?! I had some confusion with the return value of functions, arguments and the scope of variables. 

```python

# Some lambda helper functions
get_value = lambda x,y,n :x.groupby([y])[y].count().sort_values(ascending=False).head(n).values
get_index = lambda x,y,n :x.groupby([y])[y].count().sort_values(ascending=False).head(n).index
str_cleaner = lambda x : x[8:x.find("']")]    

# Combine index which is-> pandas.series.index and value which is-> numpy.ndarray then print in friendly way
def iterate_idx_val(x,y,n, message):
    idx = get_index(x,y,n)
    val = get_value(x,y,n)
    idx_val = zip(idx, val)
    for data in idx_val:
       print_p(message.format(*data))

```
>Some of the custom functions that are doing the heavy lifting. There maybe a better way to this as with all implementations. 

```python
get_value = lambda x,y,n :x.groupby([y])[y].count().sort_values(ascending=False).head(n).values
```
* `get_value()` and `get_index()` are similar functions except they both return values and index separately. It uses count and sorts the values in ascending order, I used `head(n)` the variable `n` specifies how many rows to return since I wanted users an option to view up top 5 of the results.   
* `x` = is the DataFrame
* `y` = is the Column Name
* `n` = is how many rows to return

```python
def iterate_idx_val(x,y,n, message):
    idx = get_index(x,y,n)
    val = get_value(x,y,n)
    idx_val = zip(idx, val)
    for data in idx_val:
       print_p(message.format(*data))
```
* takes 4 arguments
* `x` = is the DataFrame
* `y` = is the Column Name
* `n` = is how many rows to return
* `message` = is how I wanted the tuples returned as a message.


```python
str_cleaner = lambda x : x[8:x.find("']")] 
``` 
* Is used to print the returned tuple. Where `x` is the string. It starts at index 8 then slices after finding `']`.

***I spent a lot of time in the following:*** 

**Refactoring codes**

* I looked up how to create lambdas and python's built in functions such as `zip`, `enumerate` and `comprehensions`. Most I did not end up using but, its a good refresher. I spent so many hours refactoring all the above codes except the string cleaner!

**Formatting and printing returned series and arrays** 

* The string manipulation part and sub-setting the selected DataFrame took a while too. 

**Capturing the returned value from a function**

* In `filter_data()` function instead of returning just the filtered DataFrame. I wanted to to capture that answers based on the input. So I returned it as a tuple of values and unpacked this tuple in the main `project()` functions 

**Error handling**

* Some of my functions have `try` and `except` clause but some does not. Some are done with a `while loop` and they both work. My common mistake about this is forgetting the input solicitation inside the `try` block.

**Print 5 consecutively**

* I found this task tough, I was so close in looking how others have done it! I tried experimenting with `enumerate` so that every rows have an index that I can call from my loop. I tried `generator` function since it returns a stream of data and remembers where it left off so I was thinking I can have a start and stop triggers in the loop where the generator's stream cuts off every 5 lines but, I could not get this to work! Finally I decided I'll implement this in a `while loop`. It took a couple of tries but it worked!

```python
def prompt_user_for_data(df):
    print_p('\n\n***Printing FIVE ROWS consecutively***\n\n')
    print_p("I have " + str(len(df)) + " total rows available to view. ")
    start = 0
    fiverr = 5
    while fiverr < len(df)+10:
        answer = y_or_n('\n\nView every 5 rows of --> ')
        if answer == 'y':
            pd.set_option('display.max_rows', None)
            pd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)
            pd.set_option('display.width', 800)
            pd.set_option('display.max_colwidth', None)
            print()
            print_p(df[start:fiverr])
            fiverr = fiverr + 5
            start = fiverr - 5
        elif answer == 'n':
            break  
```

I can control which sub-set of rows in the DataFrame are retuned by `df[start:stop]` but, I needed a way for `start to DEcrement by 5` and the `stop to INcrement by 5`, since the project calls to print every 5 lines. 

And, to do all of this up to the end of the DataFrame, so I use `len(df)` and added `+10` for good measure, since not all selected DataFrames can be printed or divided by chunks of 5. When the loop reaches `len(df)+10` it will just return an `Empty DataFrame` and the loop stops! 

I did not want a truncated version so I set all of the columns and rows to be visible. 

There maybe a pandas method for doing this easily??!

## Reference materials: 
 
1. Pandas official documentations 
2. Sites like realpython, kite, and stackOverflow. 
3. Udacity's python lessons! 

## Additional Features

* Informs the user what filters are selected and how many rows of data are being aggregated on.
* Applies time filter based on the answers if month and day are selected.
* An option to view top 5 result for some of the aggregations.
* Two ways to view the data:
    * By every 5 rows 
    * By specified amount of rows to return.
* Asks user if they want to see the data again.     


>Looking ahead: Maybe make this a Flask app!

# Conclusion

This has been a great project! It could be really tough to someone who does not have a lot of python exposure and I can't imagine working with messy data! Numpy and Pandas are super powerful and Python is just a fun language to write scripts and build things! I learned a lot by completing this project!
